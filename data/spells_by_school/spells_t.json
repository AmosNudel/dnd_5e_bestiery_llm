        "You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a target has a {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB} of 300 feet and can hover; it has {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to the {@condition Prone|XPHB} condition; and it has {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the {@action Dash|XPHB} action or a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the target has the {@condition Stunned|XPHB} condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a {@action Magic|XPHB} action followed by a 1-minute transformation.",
        "If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance."
